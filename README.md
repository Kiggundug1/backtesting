Backtest your OWN TRADING BOT in Python | Tutorial

https://youtu.be/DAFQ0HHo8iY

We demonstrate how to backtest a simple trading strategy in Python. This pedagogical tutorial guides you through the steps of downloading the data on the coin using the python-binance library, cleaning the data with the pandas library, computing the indicators with the ta library, structuring neatly the backtest, and finally analysing, plotting, and commenting on the results. The strategy used as a case study is based on two simple moving averages with the pair BTC/USDT.
